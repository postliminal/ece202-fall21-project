BLE does have greater performance in terms of latency, but this is once again due to OpenThread’s self-healing feature.\nWith regards to the RSS values obtained using both BLE and OpenThread. OpenThread was much more consistent in the values reported. The RRSI values reported in the data are pretty consistent and do decreases as the distance increases from the receiver. An interesting observation is that the RSS values are clustered to a smaller range of values, such that there is not much variance in the RSS values.
