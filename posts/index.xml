      <description>Project Proposal 1. Motivation &amp;amp; Objective Indoors localization has been a highly researched topic for decades. Since GPS signals can’t reach devices inside buildings, alternative methods using radio signals (Bluetooth, 802.15.4, wifi), audio signals, visual signals, etc. have been devised and published. Given that these sensing technologies (radio, audio, video, depth) continue to improve, the indoors localization problem is still relevant and continues to be actively researched. Therefore, we seek to contribute to the ongoing research by approaching the localization problem via the implementation and experimentation of some of these algorithms in a resource constrained computing environment (Arduino Nano Sense 33 BLE).</description>

      <description>Problem: With the rise and continuous update of various IoT communication standards it is hard to keep track of what is the most suitable option. Two standards, Bluetooth (BLE 5.0 standard) and Thread (implemented using OpenThread), are either massively adopted (BLE) or rapidly gaining popularity (thread). However, there has not been a recent analysis between these two protocols.
Project Goals: Make an updated analysis between these two protocols. By using various radio configurations for both protocols we can get a better understanding on their performance and limitations.</description>

      <description>Bluetooth - BLE 5.0 A wireless communication protocol that is (almost if not already) ubiquitous. Released in 2016, BLE 5.0 introduced a few changes that make bluetooth technology suitable for more applications. New features allow:
 larger bandwidth transmissions (higher throughput = higher data speeds) multi device connection (e.g. now you can send music to two pairs of headphones from one device) larger advertising packets allow better pairing + other applications (beacons!</description>

      <description>1. Noisy measurements of RSSI in BLE and 802.15.4  python plots  if possible have multiple adv channels and compare aggregate/default/average   explanation could do some signal analysis (variance, etc?)  2. Localization results (BLE vs. Thread) It should be noted that OpenThread is a self-healing network, and since &amp;ldquo;Self-healing allows a routing-based network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable. [1]&amp;rdquo; The synchonicity of this network differs significantly from BLE.</description>

      <description>Everything that we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to do we can include it here nicely and explain what went wrong   branches we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to combine
 multitask wakework recog task    any future config changes
 the sweeps or other sweeps    any processing that could improve results
  Aspects that were worked on include:
 Running initial tinyML wake-word models within Segger in an attempt to streamline environment dependencies due to existing environment support/capabilities Deploying developed ML models outside of those supported by the CMSIS DSP toolbox Limitations of hardware space highly impacted the models and condigurations we were able to deploy due to size and storage Overall, whilst the intersections of embedded systems and its capabilities to run Machine Learning models is highly evolving.</description>
