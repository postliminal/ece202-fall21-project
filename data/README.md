Log files with a suffix "_xm" represent data taken x meters away from the receiver. For example logfile_3m is data collected using BLE three meters away from the reciever, whilst logfile_ot_1m_ is data collected using the OpenThread (hence _ot_ )framework one meter away from the reciever. These are raw log files obtained from the Segger Embedded Studio environment. 

Processed data is seperated into two folders, one fot BLE and one for OpenThread. The processed data is from those log files refrenced above.
